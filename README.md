Welcome to the Enraged Rabbit Project Github page!

This project aims to bring multimaterial capabilities to 3D printers using a single Direct Drive toolhead. While this project is mainly dedicated to be used on VORON printers, it can also be used (or adapted) on any 3D printer that runs Klipper, and potentially RRF.

## Details

There are 4 components so far : 
 - **The Enraged Rabbit Carrot Feeder (ERCF)**. The Carrot Feeder allows to use a high number of different filaments (tested up to 9 channels so far) and feed them, one at a time, into the printer toolhead. The ERCF gear motion system (i.e. what is used to push and pull the filament) is based on the Voron Design M4 extruder. The ERCF was inspired by the Prusa MMU2 and the Smuff.

 - **The Enraged Rabbit Carrot Patch (ERCP)**. It is a light spool-holder and buffer combo to help you deal with the filament  
management issue associated with multimaterial systems.

 - **The Enraged Rabbit King's Seat (ERKS)**. The Kingâ€™s Seat is a pellet-purge system to remove the need for a wipe-tower and make faster filament purges. This system is designed for Voron V2s only so far.
 - **The filament sensor** : a filament sensor system located below the extruder gears to check proper loading and unloading of filament.
  
Note that this is a work in progress !!
 
Only the King's Seat is yet to be released !
